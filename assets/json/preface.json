		"preface":"Every generation all along the line of the history of the\nchurch have a pattern of music which they use in\nworship. The kind of music that any people produce is a\nreflection of their heart condition and their relationship with\nthe Father. The songs carry the theology of the people and\nreflect their understanding of God. Songs written in the time\nof revival portray the people's experience of GOD.\n\nOur nation is passing through a period of terrible\nexperience. Yet the cry in our heart is that God should send\nus a revival. But we know certainly that any revival sent to\nus at a time when right men who know the right methods of\nministry are not on the ground would be wasted. Thus,\nbefore the revival comes, we need correct men who bears\nthe correct message and who knows the correct methods of\nministry. Such men who the master has sat upon and has\npoured His life into them. These are the disciples of Jesus\n\nSuch men who lived and laboured in the yesteryears wrote\nhymn that still communicate the mind of Christ. Here is a\ncompilation of some of such hymns and a few written by\nmen of like mind who are looking up to God for a visitation.\n\nA careful look at the music played in the Church now shows\n\nthat the Church is in the wilderness. As we pray carefully\nthrough these hymns, we are asking that God may visit His\nsaving grace upon our lives and grant us a revival that our\nland may enter into rest.\n\n",
