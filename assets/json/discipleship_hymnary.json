And often when I'm tempted to turn from the track\nI think of my Saviour, my mind wanders back,\nTo the cross where they nailed Him on Calvary's tree\nI hear a voice saying, “I suffered for thee,”\n\n3. A place I remember where I was set free,\nIt’s where I found pardon, a heaven to me,\nThere Jesus spoke sweetly, to my weary soul,\nMy sins were forgiven, He made my heart whole.\n\n4. How rich is the blessing the world cannot give.\nI’m satisfied fully for Jesus to live,\nTho: friends may forsake me and trials arise,\nI’m trusting in Jesus, His love never dies.\n5. There is no one like Jesus can cheer me today,\nHis love and His kindness can ne’er fade away,\nIn winter, in summer; in sunshine and rain\nHis love and affection are always the same\n\n6. Will you have this blessing that Jesus bestows?\nFree, full, salvation from sin bitter throes\nO come to the Saviour to Calvary flee,\nThe fountain is opened is flowing for thee.",
